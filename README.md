# ImageClassifier

A simple image classification project using TensorFlow and OpenCV. This notebook demonstrates how to build and train a deep learning model for classifying images into different categories.

## 📁 Project Structure

The main content is in the Jupyter notebook:

- `ImageClassification.ipynb`: Contains all steps from data loading to model training and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features

- Loads and preprocesses image datasets.
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Utilizes OpenCV for image manipulation.
- Visualizes training results with Matplotlib.

## 🛠️ Dependencies

Install required libraries with:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib
